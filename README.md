# IFS Series A Generator

This code is used to generate the unique digital art that constitutes the IFS Series A images. To run the code, you will need Python installed on your machine, and first run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once you have [purchased the NFT](https://opensea.io/collection/weird-math-art) for your image, you will be provided with a JSON file to place in the same directory as your code. Running

```
python ifs-generator.py
```

will create a file `output.py` in the same directory containing your image.
